        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna, a beloved Italian dish, is a culinary masterpiece that epitomizes layers of flavor and texture. At its core, this delectable creation consists of wide sheets of pasta, generously interwoven with rich and savory ingredients. The foundation is often laid with a robust meat sauce, typically prepared with a medley of ground beef, pork, and veal, seasoned to perfection with aromatic herbs and spices. Each layer is then generously smothered with a velvety béchamel sauce, adding a creamy and indulgent touch. The heart of the lasagna lies in the amalgamation of these layers, creating a harmonious symphony of taste that captivates the palate.</p>
        <p>What sets lasagna apart is its versatility, allowing for endless variations to suit individual preferences. Vegetarian renditions showcase layers of vibrant vegetables like spinach, mushrooms, and roasted peppers, while some opt for a seafood twist with layers of succulent shrimp or crab. Regardless of the variation, a finishing layer of melted mozzarella and Parmesan cheese crowns the dish, forming a golden and gooey crust that adds the perfect touch of decadence. Whether enjoyed as a comforting family meal or a centerpiece at festive gatherings, lasagna stands as a timeless culinary delight, embodying the essence of hearty Italian comfort food.</p>

    <div class="Ingredients">
        <p>· Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).
            · Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.
            · Canned tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.
            · Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.
            · Sugar: A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.
            · Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.
            · Noodles: Of course, you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.
            · Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.
            · Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).
